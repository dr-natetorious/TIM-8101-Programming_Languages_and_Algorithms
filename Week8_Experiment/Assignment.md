# Week 8 - Assignment: Reproduce a Published Experiment

## Instructions

You are a junior researcher at a world-renown, high-tech laboratory.  The senior scientist asks that you critique and replicate an experiment related to programming languages or algorithms to demonstrate your research and technical prowess to the group.  The senior scientist has not specified which experiment to analyze; however, she stipulates that it must be found within a peer-reviewed publication within the last ten years and asks that you produce a short report presenting your critique and experience replicating the experiment.

### Identify a research study

First, locate a research study that contains a reproducible experiment taking the time and resource constraints of the course into consideration.  Remember that programming languages and algorithms are very broad and can include many topics from computer science.  Almost any prior study that included creating, testing, applying, or improving a language or algorithm for pretty much any purpose would be appropriate. Ask your professor if you have any questions.

### Analyze the study

Second, analyze the original study by addressing the items described below:

- Describe the problem addressed.  Why is it important?  Is this an agreed upon problem?
- Describe what was accomplished by the study.  What was not achieved?
- Describe the methodology did the study utilize.  Was it appropriate?  Justify.
- Describe the study results and the contribution it made to the body of knowledge, if any.
- Describe possible extensions to the research, if any.  In what ways can the study be enhanced or modified to provide additional value?
- Discuss any limitations or assumptions held within the study and how they can be addressed.

### Present the study

Present the study's experiment that will be reproduced.  Be sure to outline the setup and resources utilized.

- Describe how you will reproduce the experiment.
- How does your experiment differ from the original?
- In what ways were they the same?
- How do your results compare with the original results and what conclusions can be drawn with the additional data provided by your experiment?

### Reproduce the study

Finally, reproduce the experiment and document the setup, procedure, and results.  Create any tables, graphs, raw results, or aggregate reports that would allow for direct comparison with the original study.

Your submission should be no less than five pages, in APA format, and supported by at least five academic references.

Ensure that your critique is comprehensive and meets the quality expectations of doctoral-level work.
