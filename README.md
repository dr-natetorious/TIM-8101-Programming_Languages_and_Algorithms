## Learning Objectives

New programming languages and algorithms are being proposed every day to try to solve problems faster, use less storage, and make programmers and researchers jobs easier. This course is an advanced study of the practical and theoretical principles behind the design, analysis, and implementation of algorithms and programming languages for research and professional practice.

Concepts covered in this course:

- Programming language paradigms
- Domain-specific languages
- Algorithmic complexity
- Algorithm categories and problems
- Research in algorithms and programming languages
