# Instructions

Select two algorithms from two different categories of problems (e.g., pick one encryption and one clustering algorithm).  These should be algorithms you have never implemented previously and may not involve simple linear or graph searching or sorting.  Implement the algorithms in a programming language of your choice and test the algorithms on appropriate data sets.

In a Word document, answer the following:

1. Which algorithms did you choose and why?
2. What are these algorithms used for?
3. How efficient are these algorithms for their intended purpose?  What are their best, average, and worst case performances?
4. Is there any theoretical or practical way to make them more efficient?  If so, how?  If not, why not?
5. What issues, if any, did you encounter when you implemented them?

Note: It may be useful to select an algorithm that can be re-used for your experiment replication in week 8.
