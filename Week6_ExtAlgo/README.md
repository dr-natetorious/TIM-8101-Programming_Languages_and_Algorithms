# Section 2: Week 6: Solve an Existing Problem with an Algorithm

An article recently appeared in Bloomberg Businessweek entitled "Computer Models Won’t Beat the Stock Market Any Time Soon." Dewey claims this is due to:

1. the market is a random walk that is ever changing
2. there is more signal than noise
3. there is insufficient data 4
4. as proposed by the Efficient Market Theory (EMT) the edge is too small.

This raises the following questions:

1. is there validity to his argument
2. what characteristics would need to exist in such a model.

It is not the goal of this effort to prove of disprove the position only to explore its merits within the broader state of modern scientific discovery.

Obviously if Dewey’s argument can be disproven the impact would be significant to the consumers of that computer model. They could choose economic gains or minor celebrity status within the financial community, perhaps even write a best-selling book.
