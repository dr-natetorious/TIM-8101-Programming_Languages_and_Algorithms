# Section 2: Week 6: Find a Problem Solvable with an Algorithm

## Instructions

Select a current research problem that could be addressed by a new algorithm, refinement of an old algorithm, cooperation of two or more algorithms, or application of an algorithm in a new way.  When working with scholarly sources, you will often find research ideas in sections labeled “future work.”

Write a problem statement paper, in which you address the items below.

What is the problem that should be addressed with additional research (i.e. what is going wrong?)?  Support the existence of the problem with at least three recent references.

1. What is the impact of the problem?

2. That is, how are the victims (field of study, researchers, practitioners, industry, civilians, etc.) negatively affected by the problem, when is the problem evident, and where does the issue exist or become obvious?

3. Provide an example of the problem in action or as experienced by those affected by it.  

4. Support the impact of the problem with at least three recent references.

5. Why does the problem exist? Discuss the conceptual basis, the nature of the problem, and outline of the problem as defined by the literature.  

6. Support underlying cause of the problem with at least three recent peer-reviewed references.

Length: 2 – 3 pages (not including title and references)

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
