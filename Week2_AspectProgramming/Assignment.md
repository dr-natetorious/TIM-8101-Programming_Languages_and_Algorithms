## Topic 1 – Aspect Oriented Programming

Aspect oriented programming is an extension of object oriented programming that seeks to resolve issues of encapsulation in programming concerns that transcend traditional object-oriented boundaries. For example, logging code must be scattered all over a program in modules other than the logging module. It cannot be fully encapsulated using only the object-oriented paradigm.

Read the assigned seminal works pertaining to this week’s topics on object-oriented programming and aspect oriented programming. Conduct a comprehensive literature search and locate four additional scholarly peer-reviewed works that each deal with a different current area of research in AOP. Areas of research include but are not limited to aspect mining, aspect oriented domain-specific languages, aspectization of loops, aspect weaving, and generation of test programs for aspect research.

## Topic 2 – Functional Programming Popularity

As mentioned in week 1, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use today. In fact, the top ten most popular languages are all object-oriented or procedural languages. None of the functional languages makes it on any top-ten lists. Conduct a comprehensive literature search and locate four scholarly peer-reviewed works that deal with the evaluation, feasibility, and utility of functional languages for education, research, or professional software development.

## Develop an Annotated Bibliography

Construct a thematically sorted critical annotated bibliography of all eight works addressing the items below (for each work).

* The work’s purpose
* A concise summary of its contents
* Its relevance to the topic
* An analysis of the contribution’s unique characteristics
* Your critical analysis of the study’s strengths and weaknesses.

Each annotation should consist of at least 250 words, must be formatted properly, and must have a logical flow and transition between them. The final submission must be in APA format and contain a title page, table of contents, and reference list. Ensure an intuitive correlation and reference to any works other than those directly annotated that provide additional breadth and depth to the subject matter. Also, note that the analysis of the works should not focus on any challenges faced with the technologies’ implementation, development, or application as a technological analysis will be conducted in the following week. This annotated bibliography should provide sufficient background on the topic to provide a foundation for additional scholarly work.

Your paper should demonstrate thoughtful consideration of the ideas and concepts presented in the course and provide new thoughts and insights relating directly to this topic. Your response should reflect scholarly writing and current APA standards. Be sure to adhere to Northcentral University's Academic Integrity Policy.
