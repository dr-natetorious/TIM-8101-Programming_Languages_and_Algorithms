# Instructions

Select an application or problem in computer science and two domain-specific languages that are used or have been proposed for that application or problem. For example, in compiler construction, two common domain-specific languages and accompanying tools are JavaCC (that you used previously) and yacc (Yet Another Compiler Compiler).

Write a paper in which you compare the benefits and drawbacks of the two languages. Use specific examples of scenarios: 

1. where one language and its tools might be better than the other.
2. Compare their relative adoption and the prevalence of the problem they are intended to help solve.
3. Are they mostly used in business or academia? Finally, critique both domain specific languages.
4. Are there any improvements that could be made to one or both of them?
5. Do they even need to exist at all?
6. Could their purpose be better served with an extension, set of libraries, or code written in a general purpose programming language? Why or why not?

## Requirements

Do not select compiler construction or aspect oriented programming for your application/problem.
